# liri-node-app

This code uses node.js to create an app that processes requests for various APIs and pulls information, depending on the command. The purpose of this app is to imitate Siri, but instead of voice activation, the user types in the command for an artist, title of a song, or a movie, and they get back some information about each. I made each request its own function and, for each command, made a for loop that concatenates search terms into one.
